Assignment 1 Interactive Development by Haizal Chew

This is a website made on a fictional group of band named the Meowzers. I designed it according to the most common layout 
most music artist use and based it on those. All the pages features a tab at the top to jump between pages easily. At the 
bottom of the page is the social media sites (leads to random links) for the band. 

As a fan of the band, I would like to know when will be the next concert that will play, hence the index contains all the
dates as well as location for the next tour location. Also, there is a button for me to be able to immediately choose to 
book their next concert at my nearest avaliable timing.

As a new user who might not know much of the band, I would like to find out more information about the band itself, hence
there is the about page where users can find out more about the band members and descriptions of them.

As a user who might not be familiar with the band's music, I would like to be able to listen and understand the style of 
music they might be making, hence there is their discrography tab which shows all the band past to recent albums and users
will be able to freely listen to any music from the song albums.

As a curious individual who would like to know more of the band and the website doesn't answer the question I would like to
ask, I would like to be able to directly ask the band and inquire them about certain topics, hence there is a contact page
that users would be able to input their question and be able to expect a response through email using the site.
